        <p>I've built and operated a variety of stateful distributed systems, cutting across the consistency-availability, latency-throughput, and price-performance spectra. I have taught Rust workshops worldwide, including at Mozilla (where Rust came from), Microsoft, BMW, as well as workshops on concurrency and distributed systems. I get maniacal pleasure from invalidating my assumptions, 303/808/909s and exploring.</p>

        <p>
          A self-healing distributed etcd supervisor, running on Mesos. Built when I was on the Kubernetes team at Mesosphere, allowing us to deploy full Kubernetes clusters on top of Mesos with the click of a mouse.

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd">
          etcd
        </a></h3>
        <p>
          In the process of fault injecting systems I've built on top of etcd, I've found several interesting bugs in etcd itself. I've provided minor architectural guidance that was incorporated in etcd v3.

        <p>
          A monolithic horizontally scalable Postgres-compatible database written in Go with both snapshot and serializable snapshot configurable isolation levels. I was an early contributor, and wrote a high-performance histogram-based metric system for measuring interesting operational statistics, which I later extracted into loghisto.
        </p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/serverless/event-gateway">
          event gateway
        </a></h3>
        <p>
          Dataflow for serverless systems, containers, and service. plug your things into each other easily. Make any service event-driven. I built a prototype and implemented the distributed bits of the initial system.

          loghisto
        </a></h3>
        <p>
          A high-performance histogram implementation for understanding the latency tail of a system, either in production or development. Does not rely on sampling methods which break in real systems work. Uses logarithmically bucketed histograms.
        </p>

        <h3><a href="https://oscoin.io">
          open source coin
        </a></h3>

          RustFest Paris 2018: Building Reliable Infrastructure in Rust
        </a></h3>
        <p>
          The wild success of testing tools like Jepsen is a wake-up call that we’re approaching systems engineering from a fundamentally bug-prone perspective. Why don’t we find these devastating bugs on our laptops before opening pull requests? Rust’s compiler gives us wonderful guarantees about memory safety, but as soon as we open files or sockets, all hell seems to break loose.

          This talk will show you how to apply techniques from the distributed systems and database worlds in a way that maximizes the number of bugs found per cpu cycle, and reduce the amount of bias that we hardcode into our tests.
