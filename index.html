        <p>I've built and operated a variety of stateful distributed systems, cutting across the consistency-availability, latency-throughput, and price-performance spectra. I have taught Rust workshops worldwide, including at Mozilla (where Rust came from), Microsoft, BMW, as well as workshops on concurrency and distributed systems. I get maniacal pleasure from invalidating my assumptions, 303/808/909s and exploring.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://www.hytradboi.com/2025/03580e19-4646-4fba-91c3-17eaba6935b0-throwing-it-all-away---how-extreme-rewriting-changed-the-way-i-build-databases">
          HYTRADBOI 2025: Throwing it all away - how extreme rewriting changed the way I build databases
        </a></h3>
        <p>
          This talk discusses applying safety engineering techniques to hazards associated with complexity and human time investment, and why sometimes it's a great idea to throw things away that you can't finish in a day.
        </p>

        <h3><a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/rust_techniques_sled/">
          FOSDEM 20: sled and rio - modern database engineering with io_uring
        </a></h3>
        <p>
          sled is an embedded database that takes advantage of modern lock-free indexing and flash-friendly storage. rio is a pure-rust io_uring library unlocking the linux kernel's new asynchronous IO interface. This short talk will cover techniques that have been used to take advantage of modern hardware and kernels while optimizing for long term developer happiness in a complex, correctness-critical Rust codebase.

          RustFest Paris 2018: Building Reliable Infrastructure in Rust
        </a></h3>
        <p>
          The wild success of testing tools like Jepsen is a wake-up call that we’re approaching systems engineering from a fundamentally bug-prone perspective. Why don’t we find these devastating bugs on our laptops before opening pull requests? Rust’s compiler gives us wonderful guarantees about memory safety, but as soon as we open files or sockets, all hell seems to break loose.

          This talk will show you how to apply techniques from the distributed systems and database worlds in a way that maximizes the number of bugs found per cpu cycle, and reduce the amount of bias that we hardcode into our tests.

          open source coin
        </a></h3>
        <p>
          Aims to be a decentralized github, bolted to a token. I wrote a simulator for rapidly finding bugs in consensus protocols (see my Jepsen-proof article above), wargamed various attacks against different consensus mechanisms, ultimately coming to the conclusion that it is impossible for decentralized finance to avoid concentrating power and that all governance mechanisms are trivially gamable by rich people. A system must be disruptable by the disempowered if power will ever flow back to them in ways that plug into that system.
