        <h1>models of conflict and cooperation</h1>

        <p>
          Why is everyone so mad despite getting
          so much better?
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>1. why are we hemorrhaging social cohesion despite <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCm9Ng0bbEQ">some metrics</a> suggesting that life has never been more
            prosperous?</li>
          <li>2. do we have the means of addressing climate change without a global overthrow of capitalism?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>cooperation-enabling mediation mechanisms</h2>

        <p>
          Groups that enable members to work toward desirable futures, both at the individual level and at other scales
          of social organization.
          Regardless of how crappy the place is currently, by supporting collective forward progress we can increase
          trust in each other over time. Trust is wiped out when the faith in a positive shared future as a collective
          entity is shaken.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because trust is a function of future expectations, the perceived direction of change is critical in
          determining the ability to collectively act to actually meet challenges. Positive expectations more frequently
          lead to higher-quality collaborations. Negative expectations can fragment a society into smaller subgroups who
          feel like they are drowning and will push anyone else down that they can reach in order to keep breathing air.
        </p>

        <p>
          We use various structures to mediate the vast and ever-shifting "conflict space" of conflicting human needs.
          Our trust in our society is heavily dependent on our perceived ability to drive the in-place
          conflict-shaping structures in a direction that is up to the task of mediating experienced conflict. Courts,
          laws, unions, telegram groups, etc... We have a wide variety of structures and we are constantly inventing new
          ones that can be wielded by various societal granularities.
        </p>

        <p>
          But when these mechanisms fail to effectively mediate conflicts, and successive attempts to instate
          mediating structures are met with powerful resistance, it causes the trust that forms the core of any
          functioning society to rot away. Relationships that were once mediated through more or less consensual,
          if not ideal, acts of cooperation give way to more coercive means of domination.
        </p>


        <h2>The Universe of Obligation</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.facinghistory.org/holocaust-and-human-behavior/chapter-2/universe-obligation">The
            Universe of Obligation</a> is a phrase coined by sociologist Helen Fein, who describes it as the people
          "Toward whom obligations are owed, to whom rules apply, and whose injuries call for amends."
        </p>

        <h2>Bretton Woods, the Meidner Plan, and Vietnam War Debts</h2>

        <p>
          Toward the end of WWII, the major economic powers of the world gathered in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire
          to discuss a system of international financial cooperation aiming to prevent financial that exacerbated
          foreign relations in the interwar period. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system">The
            Bretton Woods System</a>
          tied the major economic powers to the US dollar at fixed exchange rates that were permitted to fluctuate by up
          to 1% each year,
          along with a system of capital controls that reduced the risk of capital flight, tax evasion, speculative
          attacks and deindustrialization.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a result of these capital controls, models such as <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehn%E2%80%93Meidner_model">The Meidner Plan</a>
          became feasible, although never fully implemented. Variations of the plan were proposed by
          both Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren during the Democratic primary leading up to the 2020 presidential
          election.
        </p>

        <p>
          I see two classes of globally-expanding conflict that are insufficiently mediated by our current mix of
          structures:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>1. inter-generational conflict between young and old</li>
          <li>2. inter-class conflict between rich and poor</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The old are preventing the young from working toward desirable futures. The rich are preventing the
          poor from working toward desirable futures. There is significant overlap, but not enough to treat
          these as a single issue. These are strong claims and they will be expanded
          upon below.
        </p>

        <p>
          Society is decohering into tribes who have lost faith
          in the value of working together. Despite metrics claiming global extreme poverty to be at historically
          low rates, class and generational relations within developed countries are deteriorating.
        </p>

        <h2></h2>

        <h2>humans do not sacrifice convenience lightly</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.nickbostrom.com/information-hazards.pdf">Nick Bostrom's Information Hazards: A Typology
            of Potential Harms from Knowledge</a>
          is a wonderful collection of

          Climate change sacrifices the QALY-capacity of young and poor people
          for the convenience of those who probably won't live to see as many negative effects due to wealth or age.
          This is driving the fragmentation of society into groups who are able to maintain coherence within their own
          structures. This is
          reducing our ability to mediate derivitave-yet-existential issues like climate change and generally having
          friendly relations.

        <h2>summary of "Why Technology and Markets Alone Can't Avoid Overshoot" from Limits to Growth: The 30-Year
          Update</h2>
        <p>
          I am not a techno optimist. The rate at which pessimistic models are being invalidated by measured data is
          extremely concerning to me, because it is clear that our ability to guess how bad things will get is failing
          to account for some number of critical omitted variables. The book "limits to growth: 30-year update" by the
          celebrated systems theorist donella meadows has a section titled "why technology and markets alone can't avoid
          overshot" that I believe has a number of compelling reasons why I believe we need a more strongly course
          correcting action than what entrepreneurs are going to be able to realistically address.

          I believe a lot of people are better off now, and that by several compelling metrics we are enjoying less
          (physical) violence right now than before, but I believe this is being primarily driven by rapidly depleting
          an unknown number of critical resources that support medium term growth but constitute an externality on
          future generations where we are restricting their available decisions heavily to support systems that would
          otherwise lose profitability.
        </p>

        <h2>nazis are actually a thing</h2>
        <p>
          I see nazis rising all around me in Europe due to the existing systems failing to allow them to live the lives
          they expected based on the decisions that have made - causing them to reach for more extreme viewpoints that
          give them a sense of dignity. I see the same happening in the US, and when I talk to friends who have been
          involved in various forms of political organizing in the US, they uniformly express extreme concern and they
          all talk about this being more unstable than anything they experienced in the 60s etc...

          Everyday people who have been losing stability bit by bit since the 70s. Profits have grown in this time, but
          real wages have declined.
        </p>

        <h2>choice of models</h2>
        <p>
          Neoclassical econ (NCE hereafter) says wages come from marginal value added by the last employee, being
          intentionally
          "depoliticized" in the early 1900s to be more competitive for departmental funding by attempting to be as
          quantitative and Positive as physics, but anyone who has run a business knows that there are simple trade-offs
          between profits and wages, mediated by political employee actions. I think the NCE models work well for their
          purposes, but their purposes have nothing to do with helping humans generally meet their expectations and
          achieve long term goals that they want to believe in. There are other models that allow for reasoning about
          these political aspects of normal life, and they are extensively backed by empirical evidence. This is why I
          find Shaikh, sraffa etc useful - the fact that they do not apply to the same problems as NCE due to being
          intentionally open to modeling more political realities (while fitting real data far better at the firm level
          and lower) is exactly why they are interesting to me
